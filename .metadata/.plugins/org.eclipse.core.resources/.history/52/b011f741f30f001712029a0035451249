Assignment 03
Due: Thursday 03/23/2017 by 11:59 p.m. to meckmann@skidmore.edu

1. Finish implementation of K-means clustering
   - to visualize your clusters, assign each class a different color
     and output an image
   - if use R, G and B only as your clustering characteristics, then
     the average (mean) color of each cluster is good choice for 
     display
   - if use any other characteristics, visualize using some premade
     standard set of colors (have 16 prepared) and if say your K
     is 5, only use the first 5,  if K is 16 use all 16 colors

2. Use the code I already wrote for colorization which is an implementation
   of the main technique from the Welsh paper (uses l-alpha-beta color space,
   does luminance remapping, random jittered sampling, etc.)

   - instead of the l-alpha-beta color conversion, treat the
     intensity of a pixel in the color image as the luminance, and in the
     grayscale image, the value of the pixel is its intensity.  Still do
     remapping and all the other steps (just don't use l-alpha-beta color
     space)

   - cluster the color and grayscale image with k-means (same k for each)
     and use those clusters as the swatches.
      --- you'll need to figure out which cluster in the color image is the
          most appropriate match to the cluster that the grayscale pixel in
          question is part of.
          --- then you'll want to grab the color of an appropriate pixel
              within that cluster of the color image to assign to output

    --- I will flesh this part out a bit more before due date

Attach a zip file (please do not create a rar file) with all the code and:

  submit all the java files necessary for me to compile your program
